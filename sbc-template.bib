%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

Future platforms must provide strong support for adaptive behaviour in order both to maintain and optimise services in the face of changing context. We use a survey of existing middleware systems to develop some core themes that characterise and constrain the ability of these approaches to support the development of adaptive and autonomic systems, and draw some possible trends for developing future platforms more appropriate to these domains.",

@article{Heinzelman2004,
abstract = {Current trends in computing include increases in both distribution and wireless connectivity, leading to highly dynamic, complex environments on top of which applications must be built. The task of designing and ensuring the correctness of applications in these environments is similarly becoming more complex. The unified goal of much of the research in distributed wireless systems is to provide higher-level abstractions of complex low-level concepts to application programmers, easing the design and implementation of applications. A new and growing class of applications for wireless sensor networks require similar complexity encapsulation. However, sensor networks have some unique characteristics, including dynamic availability of data sources and application quality of service requirements, that are not common to other types of applications. These unique features, combined with the inherent distribution of sensors, and limited energy and bandwidth resources, dictate the need for network functionality and the individual sensors to be controlled to best serve the application requirements. In this article, we describe different types of sensor network applications and discuss existing techniques for managing these types of networks. We also overview a variety of related middleware and argue that no existing approach provides all the management tools required by sensor network applications. To meet this need, we have developed a new middleware called MiLAN. MiLAN allows applications to specify a policy for managing the network and sensors, but the actual implementation of this policy is effected within MiLAN. We describe MiLAN and show its effectiveness through the design of a sensor-based personal health monitor.},

abstract = {A distributed Java Virtual Machine (DJVM) spanning multiple cluster nodes can provide a true parallel execution environment for multi-threaded Java applications. Most existing DJVMs suffer from the slow Java execution in interpretive mode and thus may not be efficient enough for solving computation-intensive problems. We present JESSICA2, a new DJVM running in JIT compilation mode that can execute multi-threaded Java applications transparently on clusters. JESSICA2 provides a single system image (SSI) illusion to Java applications via an embedded global object space (GOS) layer. It implements a cluster-aware Java execution engine that supports transparent Java thread migration for achieving dynamic load balancing. We discuss the issues of supporting transparent Java thread migration in a JIT compilation environment and propose several lightweight solutions. An adaptive migrating-home protocol used in the implementation of the GOS is introduced. The system has been implemented on x86-based Linux clusters and significant performance improvements over the previous JESSICA system have been observed.},

@article{rafda,
abstract = {Middleware technologies often limit the way in which object classes may be used in distributed applications due to the fixed distribution policies that they impose. These policies permeate applications developed using existing middleware systems and force an unnatural encoding of application level semantics. For example, the application programmer has no direct control over inter-address-space parameter passing semantics. Semantics are fixed by the distribution topology of the application, which is dictated early in the design cycle. This creates applications that are brittle with respect to changes in distribution. This paper explores technology that provides control over the extent to which inter-address-space communication is exposed to programmers, in order to aid the creation, maintenance and evolution of distributed applications. The described system permits arbitrary objects in an application to be dynamically exposed for remote access, allowing applications to be written without concern for distribution. Programmers can conceal or expose the distributed nature of applications as required, permitting object placement and distribution boundaries to be decided late in the design cycle and even dynamically. Inter-address-space parameter passing semantics may also be decided independently of object implementation and at varying times in the design cycle, again possibly as late as run-time. Furthermore, transmission policy may be defined on a per-class, per-method or per-parameter basis, maximizing plasticity. This flexibility is of utility in the development of new distributed applications, and the creation of management and monitoring infrastructures for existing applications.},

@article{SMEPP,
abstract = {The increasing presence of embedded devices with internet access capabilities constitutes a new challenge in software development. These devices are now cooperating in a distributed manner towards what has been called as " Internet of Things " . In this new scenario the client-server model is sometimes not adequate and dynamic ad-hoc networks are more common than before. However, security poses as a hard issue as these systems are extremely vulnerable. In this paper, we introduce SMEPP project, which aims at developing a middleware designed for P2P systems with a special focus on embedded devices and security. SMEPP is designed to be deployed in a wide range of devices. It tries to ease the development of applications hiding platforms details and other aspects such as scalability, adaptability and interoperability. A full implementation of this middleware is already available that incorporates security features specially designed for low-resource devices. Moreover, we describe two business applications being developed using this middleware in the context of " Digital Home " and " Environmental Monitoring in Industrial Environments " .},

@article{c-mosden,
abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions billions of sensors deployed around us and connected to the Internet, where the mobile crowd sensing technologies are widely used to collect data in different contexts of the IoT paradigm. Due to the popularity of Big Data technologies, processing and storing large volumes of data has become easier than ever. However, large scale data management tasks still require significant amounts of resources that can be expensive regardless of whether they are purchased or rented (e.g. pay-as-you-go infrastructure). Further, not everyone is interested in such large scale data collection and analysis. More importantly, not everyone has the financial and computational resources to deal with such large volumes of data. Therefore, a timely need exists for a cloud-integrated mobile crowd sensing platform that is capable of capturing sensors data, on-demand, based on conditions enforced by the data consumers. In this paper, we propose a context-aware, specifically, location and activity-aware mobile sensing platform called C-MOSDEN ( Context-aware Mobile Sensor Data ENgine) for the IoT domain. We evaluated the proposed platform using three real-world scenarios that highlight the importance of 'selective sensing'. The computational effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed platform are investigated and is used to highlight the advantages of context-aware selective sensing.},

@article{FamiWare,
abstract = {Most of the middlewares currently available focus on one type of device (e.g., TinyOS sensors) and/or are designed with one requirement in mind (e.g., data management). This is an important limitation since most of the AmI applications work with several devices (such as sensors, smartphones or PDAs) and use a high diversity of low-level services . Ideally, the middleware should provide a single interface for accessing all those services able to work in heterogeneous devices. To address this issue, we propose a family of configurable middleware (FamiWare) with a really flexible architecture, instead of building a single version of a middleware with a rigid structure. In this work, we present the architecture of our middleware that can be configured, following a Software Product Line approach, in order to be instantiated in a particular device fulfilling specific application requirements. Furthermore, we evaluate that the decisions taken at architecture and implementation are the adequate ones for this kind of constrained devices.},

abstract = {Despite the proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) platforms for building and deploying IoT applications in the cloud, there is still no easy way to integrate heterogeneous geographically and administratively dispersed sensors and IoT services in a semantically interoperable fashion. In this paper we provide an overview of the OpenIoT project, which has developed and provided a first-of-kind open source IoT platform enabling the semantic interoperability of IoT services in the cloud. At the heart of OpenIoT lies the W3C Semantic Sensor Networks (SSN) ontology, which provides a common standards-based model for representing physical and virtual sensors. OpenIoT includes also sensor middleware that eases the collection of data from virtually any sensor, while at the same time ensuring their proper semantic annotation. Furthermore, it offers a wide range of visual tools that enable the development and deployment of IoT applications with almost zero programming. Another key feature of OpenIoT is its ability to handle mobile sensors, thereby enabling the emerging wave of mobile crowd sensing applications. OpenIoT is currently supported by an active community of IoT researchers, while being extensively used for the development of IoT applications in areas where semantic interoperability is a major concern.},

The goal was to describe a unique set of requirements that middleware systems should attempt to guarantee the development of integrated applications . Among many core complex services , the IoT / HPC challenges are related to the support of sensing , actuating , storage and processing services combined in a single middleware alternative . We evaluated a set of Java solutions which were classified separately into three types : Internet of Things , High - Performance Computing and Cloud of Things . We also compared them following the same IoT / HPC requirements . The conclusion is that there is still a substantial gap in the integration of Internet of Things and High - Performance Computing and vice - versa in the middleware literature , but there are user applications that require this integration ; thus , a middleware proposal project becomes fundamental for simplifying such development .},
